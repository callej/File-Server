# File-Server
A small beginners Kotlin project as part of JetBrains Academy's Basic Kotlin Track. The project implements a client-server solution for a file server. Any type of file can be uploaded and stored on the server and then later be retrieved or deleted. The server needs to be started first before the client can be started to send a request.
